Adafruit_SH1106 STM32
===============

Adafruit graphic library for SH1106 driver lcds.

some small oled lcd use SH1106 driver.

I change the adafruit SSD1306 to SH1106

SH1106 driver similar to SSD1306. thus, just change the display() method. 
 
However, SH1106 driver don't provide several functions such as scroll commands.
